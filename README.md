# Super-Stay
Super-Stay is a React-based web application that leverages the Maybelline Makeup API to showcase the complete range of Maybelline products. With the capability to filter products by category, favorite any product, and view detailed descriptions in a popup modal, users can have a seamless experience. Additionally, Super-Stay is designed with responsiveness in mind, ensuring that the application is accessible across various screen sizes and devices.


About this project
This is a simple Maybelline Makeup website. After learning about external APIs and fetch method in JavaScript(React), I decided to test my understanding by building this simple Makeup website. I used external API from Mixed Analytics. Check the live [demo][https://super-stay.vercel.app/] here

So you might not be familliar with fetch method, and you are wondering what the heck is fetch. Fetch() is a JavaScript(React) method used to request data from a server. If you want to read about fetch, you can check out this link that I used to learn about fetch.


## Installation
To run the Super-Stay application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    git clone https://github.com/your-username/super-stay.git

2. Install the dependencies:

    cd super-stay
    
    npm install

3. Start the development server:

    npm start
    
4. Open the application in your browser at http://localhost:3000.

## Technologies
Super-Stay is built using the following technologies:

React.js
Maybelline Makeup API
plain CSS
Bootstrap

## Features
Super-Stay includes the following features:

### Filter by Category:  
Users can filter products by category using the buttons on the home page.

### Add to Favorites:
Users can add products to their favorites list by clicking the favorite button on the product card.

### Popup Modal: 
Users can view a detailed product description by clicking the "Product Dscription" button on the product card. The product description is displayed in a popup modal.

## Deployment
Super-Stay is deployed on Vercel, a cloud platform for serverless deployment. Vercel makes it easy to deploy and manage React applications, with features like automatic scaling, SSL encryption, and continuous deployment.


By deploying the Super-Stay project on Vercel,I was able to make it publicly accessible and shareable with others. You can access the live version of the Super-Stay application at https://super-stay.vercel.app/.

Apart from implementing the fetch method, I implemented some other client-side functionalities such as:

Filter - This enables users to filter products by category
Favorite/Remove - It allows users to add a product to their favorite list and also remove from favorite.
Popupescriptions in a popup modal, 

The website also provides the global price and ratings of Maybelline products since the data
